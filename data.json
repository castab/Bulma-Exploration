It occurred to me that I could use a MOSFET to control the current flow of a higher voltage source using a low voltage PWM signal. The idea was just too good to let go from my mind so I scribbled notes on one of the napkins!"

Shortly after my involvement with the Wild West Shootout Game, I just couldn't get enough of these things and thought to myself, what if the same idea was applied to 10-, 30-, 50-, or even 100-watt LEDs? So, using a little circuit know-how, I prototyped a controllable 50-watt RGB LED."
